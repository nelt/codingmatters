=============

This is kind of my own sandbox.

Eventually some project will popout as standalone projects with their own repository. 

* [**codingmatters-graphviz**](https://github.com/nelt/codingmatters-graphviz) popuped out on 2013/09/07 : it uses fluent builders to guide the generation of graphviz files from java.
